## Guiding questions:

- How do indie developers choose between forward and deferred rendering pipelines with limited resources?
- What anti-aliasing techniques offer the best quality-to-performance ratio for indie games targeting diverse hardware?
- How do shader graphs versus hand-coded shaders impact iteration speed and visual quality in small teams?
- What rendering optimizations are most critical when developing for multiple platforms with a small team?
- How do indie developers balance visual fidelity with performance constraints compared to AAA studios?
- What creative technical solutions have successful indie games employed to achieve distinctive visual styles efficiently?
- How does the choice of rendering pipeline and shader workflow affect an indie game's scalability and maintainability?

## Introduction (100-150 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Synthesizing*

- **Hook**: Open with a compelling statement or industry example
- **Context**: Briefly introduce the topic and its relevance to technical art
- **Thesis Statement**: Clearly state your main argument or perspective
- **Roadmap**: Outline what the essay will cover


As game engines evolve, technical art optimisation has become increasingly critical for indie developers as they compete against triple A companies to produce industry standard games. The battle for small teams between larger teams has impacted indie developers to adjust their workflows and resources to make it as cost effective as they can whilst maintaining quality in their work. This is very relevant in regards to technical art as technical art can be quite expensive in terms of time, optimisation and also the materials used so indie teams often have to take shortcuts. (Vapidvim, 2024). My perspective on this is 

In this essay I plan to discuss how indie developers optimize technical art by balancing performance and visual quality through choices in rendering pipelines, shaders and anti-aliasing, while exploring creative solutions and cross-platform considerations that impact scalability and efficiency. I will also be exploring how these choices affect speed and maintainability compared to triple A studios. 


## Background/Historical Context (150-200 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Connecting*

- Provide technical foundation and definitions
- Explain the evolution or current state of the technology
- Reference key developments or milestones
- Use academic and industry sources to support claims

**Research Integration:**
- Include at least 2-3 academic or industry sources
- Use inline citations: "According to Smith (2023), [concept]..."
- Reference technical documentation, GDC talks, or research papers


## Critical Analysis (300-400 words)
*Assessment Focus: Exploring + Connecting + Situating*

This is the core of your essay. Address multiple perspectives:

### Technical Perspective
- How does the technology work?
- What are the technical advantages and limitations?
- Include specific examples from game engines (Unity, Unreal, etc.)

### Industry Practice
- How do professional studios implement this?
- What workflows or best practices have emerged?
- Reference real game examples or case studies

### Critical Considerations
- Performance implications
- Accessibility for different team sizes/budgets
- Platform-specific considerations
- Environmental/ethical considerations (e.g., power consumption, accessibility)
